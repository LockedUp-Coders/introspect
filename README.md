# introspect
to track what you're doing. Simply copy the given lines, and create a new file in the folder depending on today's date. For example, if today is June  16, and your username is yashkumarverma then you will create a new file in `june/16/yashkumarverma.md`

Blockers are basically things that you are stuck on. You can refer [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LockedUp-Coders/introspect/master/june/16/yashkumarverma.md) for reference

This is the template you would follow. Do not remove the headings, as this would be parsed later on via code.
