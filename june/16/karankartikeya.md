# Yesterday
- I learned about various online editors like Glitch and Codepen
- I commented on issue #27 in the nostalgify for my preview of the Navbar
- I learned about the sticky navbar and fixed navbar

# Today
- I issued a PR to the User interface for adding the navbar page
- I will try to read the Backend scripts which have been merged

# Blockers
- Is it good to start reading the Backend scripts for learning `Backend` ?
    -If not, then guide me how to start with it
