# Yesterday
- I was trying to learn about dialogflow 
- I created a pull request for issue #22 

# Today 
- I created a pull request again for issue #22 because the previous one had some conflict in merging
- I will try learning more about CI/CD

# Blockers
- I am facing issues in understanding the travis error and codecov result , so if anyone could help me in that it would be great
